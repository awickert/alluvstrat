[grid]
dz = 0.1 ; [m]
dx = 1 ; [m]
B = 2001 ; [m]

[channel]
b = 201 ; meters, must be odd and multiple of dx
h = 5 ; meters
eta = 0 ; Starting bed elevation; should probably stay at zero
etadot_ch = 0.01 ; aggradation rate [m/yr]
zetadot = 0.1 ; lateral migration rate [m/yr]

[overbank]
; Should include options of different overbank aggradation schemes
etadot_ob_xstar = 200 ; [m] levee exponential decay constant
